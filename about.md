title: About the Active Archives Initiative
---

The Active Archives Initiative (AAI) is a research initiative at MIT focused on developments in participatory digital archives.

### Why Active?
Our goal is to research and develop projects involving open interpretation, annotation, and curation of materials from archives and collections. Too often, such archival material sits untouched in basement boxes or behind arcane digital interfaces, lacking the infrastructure to support participation and storymaking by interested visitors. Moreover, institutional archives are often portrayed and controlled as static, immutable, and canonical. We aim to make digital archives useful and engaging to community members, scholars, and other users, opening up the archive to radical participation.
